"""Authenticated whole-installation backup and restore for the pinned V2 profile.

Restoring is deliberately a two-phase operation: the request is staged, and the
host applies it on the next start before the store is opened. See
``companion_v2/storage/backup.py`` for why the live connection is never rebuilt.

Two host-side rules matter as much as the engine's:

* The engine is synchronous and touches gigabytes of disk. Running it inside the
  route's ``async`` body would block AstrBot's event loop for the whole operation
  (no messages, no web requests, no timers), so every call is handed to a worker
  thread (review P1-1).
* Two operations must not interleave. ``_control_lock`` is only held for the cheap
  identity/session check: holding it across a multi-minute snapshot would stall
  message delivery authorization for everyone else. The work itself is serialized
  by ``backup_operation_lock`` — one plain ``threading.Lock`` per controller, held
  by the worker for the entire call.
